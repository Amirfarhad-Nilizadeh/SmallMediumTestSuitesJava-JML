# BeyondBranchCoverage(Java+JML)


The small and medium test suites are available in the TestSuites directory.

In the "NotVerified" directory, you can find two subdirectories for small and medium test suites. They have all repaired programs that extended static checker of OpenJML did not verify. There are two more subdirectories in each subdirectory with the name "Overfitted" and "FalseNegatives." Overfitted have repaired programs that pass the test suite, but they are not correct patches. Also, FalseNegatives are repaired correct programs, but OpenJML could not verify them, and they need more specification to verify the repaired programs.
